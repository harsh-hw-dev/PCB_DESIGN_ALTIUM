<h3 align="center">A Compact, Rule-Driven PCB Design Optimized for IoT Applications</h3>

## 🧠 Project Overview
This project showcases a **4-layer ESP32-C3 IoT Development Board**, fully designed in **Altium Designer**.  
The goal was to implement a structured, **rules-driven PCB design process** — covering component placement, stackup planning, constraint management, and DRC validation.

The **4-layer stackup** was created for stable power delivery and clean signal integrity:
- **In1.Cu:** Dedicated Ground Plane  
- **In2.Cu:** Dedicated 3.3V Plane  

These planes ensure low noise, reliable return paths, and improved RF performance for the ESP32-C3 module.

## 🔍 Key Learnings & Design Highlights

### 1. 🧩 Zoned Design
- Components were grouped into **logical regions** — *MCU Core, Power Supply, Sensor Interfaces, and Programming Section* — to maintain short, efficient signal paths.  
- Power distribution used the **internal 3.3V plane** along with **VBUS, 5V, and GND copper pours** on the outer layers to achieve compact routing and minimal voltage drop.

### 2. ⚙️ Rules-Driven Design (Altium Constraints)
- Created and managed **10+ custom Net Classes** (for I²C, SPI, 3.3V, VBUS, GPIO, etc.) in **Altium’s PCB Rules & Constraints Editor**.  
- Each class had dedicated **trace width, clearance, and via size rules**, enabling early detection of design violations and ensuring manufacturability.

### 3. 🕳️ Strategic Via Usage
- Implemented **via stitching** across GND regions to form a solid reference plane and reduce EMI.  
- Controlled via aspect ratios and pad stacks for reliability during PCB fabrication.
